## Process description

In this part, I explain the product development path.

I've split all the requirements into user stories, and then into subtasks.

Even though these code has to be sent as a zip file, each user story is developed in their specific branch following `conventional-commits`, merged into the main branch but keeping it alive.

- As a developer, I want to have an initial setup with Vue.js.
- As a user, I want to have a list of vehicle cards.
- As a user, I want to save my preferred vehicles and keep them saved if a refresh the page.
- As a user, I want to be able to show the current KM of the vehicle.
- As a user, I want to be able to show the current MILES of the vehicle.
- As a user, I want to find vehicles introducing the make, model and version.
- As a user, I want to have not free vehicles disabled.
- As a user, I want to have an error handler of the whole application (notification system).
